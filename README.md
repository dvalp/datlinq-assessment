### Datlinq DataLabs Assessment

Welcome to the assessment for data science and/or engineering position at Datlinq.
The fact that you made it this far means that we see a lot of potential and you seem a great fit for the team & company.

To really understand the level of your skills and you affinity with data we'd like to ask you to take this repository as a basis and develop a small proof of concept using (at least some) of the supplied data. 


## Data

Our data is mostly information about the location & properties of point of sales for FMCG.
In the sample-data folder you'll find small samples of datasets that we use ourselves extensively on a daily basis.
This is very similar to the data that you would be using at your position at Datlinq.

Of course the real datasets are more in number, size, have a lot more details and are not as static, but this will give you a general idea.

Details about the specific data sets are described in accompanying markdown files in the data-sample folder.

## Assignment

Show us what you've got. 

You can either do some data analysis, generating a small report of interesting facts/findings about the sources. Maybe even an interactive chart.

You could also build a small data ingestion engine using tools & techniques you know and like.

Perhaps even add some machine learning for linking data or enriching the data.

These are just some options. We'd love to see what you come up with.

Do try to think about what would be useful for Datlinq or our clients. 
This is very broad, but it also gives us an idea whether you understand our mission and checks if your interests align with ours.

## Submission

Submit your repository & code (github / bitbucket / download link) and optionally links to final products & instructions how to run them.

We understand that you cannot do exhaustive research on the data, but we'd love to see how you approach these problems. 
So please commit any notebooks, cleaning steps, processing scripts and take us step-by-step through your process. 

So for us it's not as important that you found the most interesting insights, but that you can do reproducible research and or build well crafted & documented code.


## Limit

There are no set restrictions or limits, within reason.

We'd love for you to use tools that we use (Spark, Scala, Python), but we'd rather see you using something you're fluent with.

You may use additional outside data sources.

## Questions

If you have any questions don't hestitate to mail <mailto:lous@datlinq.com>

Good luck!
